This App illustrates how to get the back-end Express app and the front-end React app to work together. To do this
VERY simple back-end and front-end applications are used. 

To run this code:
1. cd backend
2. npm install
3. cd backend/frontend
4. npm install
5. cd backend
6. npm run dev


7. Securing the app

 I secured the application using Helmet. js which is a useful Node. js module that helps
you secure HTTP headers returned by your Express apps
The headers provide important metadata about the HTTP request 
or response so the client (browser) and server can send additional information in a transaction. 

8. How to use the app
use the nav bar to navigate through the menu components
select music/videos/movies/audio-books
Search what you may- you can results to the favorites
